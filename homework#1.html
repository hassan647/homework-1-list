<h1>FAVORITE FOOD</h1>
<p>This session is for how to prepare an mango ice cream</p>

<!--Now we will make an unorder list of the required components-->
<ul>
	<li>2 large mangoes , ripe and juicy - to make 2 cups puree </li>
		<li>395 g / 14 oz sweetened condensed milk</li>
			<li>2 cups thickened cream / heavy cream / whipping cream , cold</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp yellow liquid food colouring (optional)</li>
</ul>
<!--after unorderlist now we will make an order list of step by step method of making an mango ice cream:)-->
<ol>
	<li>Combine cooled mango and condensed milk in a bowl. Add food colouring if using. Whisk until combined.</li>
	<li>Beat cream with a hand held beater or stand mixer until stiff peaks form</li>
	<li>Take a scoop of cream and put it in the mango mixture. Fold through until mostly combined - lumps is fine (this is just to lighten it up a bit).
</li>
	<li>Then pour the mango mixture into the cream. Fold through (see video) rather than mixing vigorously like you would cake batter, until lump free. This will take a few minutes.
</li>
	<li>Pour into a container (preferably with a lid). I recommend glass, if you can, or other non reactive container.
</li>
	<li>Place a piece of baking / parchment paper on the surface. Then place lid on or using cling wrap.
Freeze for 12+ hours.</li>
	<li>Remove parchment paper. Stand for 5 minutes to soften slightly, then scoop and serve!
</li>
<li>If frozen for 24 hours or longer, it will need a couple of extra minutes to soften to a scoop able consistency.</li>
</ol>
